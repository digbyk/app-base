This is my template for new project. Not quite MEAN, but Node, Express and Mongo.

All ready for OpenShift deployment too.

Uses Grunt for Less compilation.

Added master, staging and develop branches. Should use feature branches too.

Added pre-commit hooks to prevent commits in master and staging.
